<h1> Historic Calendars of Europe <hr noshade> </h1>

<h1> 1. About Calendar Reform </h1>
<ul>

<p> The modern calendar of Europe is the Gregorian calendar which 
was implemented in 1582 by Pope Gregory XIII.  It replaced the 
Julian calendar, which had been in use since the fourth century.
The conversion of dates kept in the earlier Julian form requires 
both precision in the historical identification of the problem and proper 
calculations.

<p> If everyone in Europe had converted from the Julian calendar to the
Gregorian calendar at the same time, this program would not be necessary.
Unfortunately, different regions of Europe adopted the Gregorian calendar
at different times ranging from the initial adoption by the Roman Catholic
Church in 1582 through the early twentieth century in countries such
as Russia, Greece and Turkey.

</ul>
<h2> 1a. The Solar-Year Problem </h2>
<ul>

<p> The problem which both the Gregorian and Julian calendars try to fix
is that the solar year is not exactly 365 days long.  Both calendars try
to keep the same annual solar events on the same days of the calendar
year.  The Julian calendar makes the assumption that the year is 365.25
days long, while the Gregorian calendar assumes that the year is 365.2425
days long.

</ul>
<h2> 1b. The Missing-Day Problem </h2>
<ul>

<p> The spring equinox was set to the date 21 March in the year 325 by 
the council of Nicea.  By the year 1582, the spring equinox was 
occurring on the 11th of March.  As a result of generations 
of concern, the pope ordered that 10 days would be removed from the 
calendar so that the spring equinox would return to 21 March.
It was decided that the days 5-14 October from the year 1582 would
be skipped during the transformation from the Julian to Gregorian calendar.
(Those dates were acceptable because there were no important feasts 
taking place during the days being skipped).


<p> There was great resistance to the adoption of the Gregorian calendar,
and its acceptance was determined locally. Protestant and Orthodox parts
of Europe were particularly resistant. In general the Protestant world 
adopted the Gregorian calendar in the eighteenth century, while the 
Orthodox world did not accept it until the twentieth.  For example,
England converted in 1752, while Russia and Greece did not adopt
the Gregorian calendar until 1918 and 1924 respectively.

</ul>
<h2> 1c. The New-Year's-Day Problem </h2>
<ul>

<p> The year of pagan Romans at the start of the fourth century had begun
on January first.  Christian communities were encouraged to differentiate 
themselves by adopting more significant feast days for the start of
the year.  The first day of the year in the Julian calendar was March
25.  Ironically, the Gregorian reform re-instituted January 1 as the 
first day of the year.

<p> The <i>hcal</i> program does not currently make provisions for 
variation in year demarkations, but some of the principal 
traditions are noted in <a href=#4>section 4</a> below

<a name=1d> </a>
</ul>
<h2> 1d. The Two-Step-Adoption Problem </h2>
<ul>

<p> Some regions adopted the first of January as the beginning of the
year <i>before</i> they adopted the Gregorian calendar.  Other
regions, such as Venice, kept March 1 as their new year even after they
adopted the Gregorian calendar -- until the collapse of the Republic
of Venice in 1797.

<a name=1e> </a>
</ul>
<h2> 1e. The Variable-Adoption Problem </h2>
<ul>

<p> There was great fragmentation of time-keeping methods in some
parts of Europe over the first two or so centuries of Gregorian
reform.  Almost every province of Germany and Switzerland, for
example, had an independent practice, often reflecting vicissitudes
in its religious persuasion.  Sweden reverted to the Julian calendar
in 1600 after once switching to the Gregorian calendar and did
not re-adopt the Gregorian calendar again until 1753.

<h2> 3. Algorithm for Generating Julian and Gregorian Calendars </h2>
<ul>

<p> The Julian calendar is usually 365 days long.  If the
year is divisible by 4 without a remainder, then the 
29th of February is added to the year making the length of 
the year 366 days. 

<p>1 Jan of the year 1 A.D. is on Saturday in the Julian
calendar and is on Monday in the Gregorian calendar (the
Gregorian calendar is two days behind the Julian calendar 
at this point).  

<p> The Gregorian calendar is similar to the Julian calendar,
but if the year is divisible by 100, then there is no leap day
in that year; however if the year is divisible by 400, then 
the leap day is included.  Thus, the year
2000 is a leap year in the Gregorian calendar, but the year
1900 is not.


<p> The first day for which the two calendars are in synchronization is
1 March 200.  From then through 28 February 300, the dates
in each calendar are identical, <i>e.g.</i>, the date 
5 May 267 in one calendar is also the date 5 May 267 in the other
calendar.

<p> The day of the week is always the same for days occurring in the 
Julian and Gregorian calendars (<i>e.g.</i>, Tuesday in the Gregorian
calendar is always Tuesday in the Julian calendar)
; however, the day of the month
for any given solar day is different in each calendar.  About once a century, 
the Julian calendar shifts ahead of the Gregorian calendar by one day.  
The table below shows the number of days by which the Julian calendar
is in advance of the Gregorian calendar:
<ul>

                No. of days Julian dates are      
     Years        ahead of Gregorian dates.

   301 -  499           1  
   501 -  599           2
   601 -  699           3
   701 -  899           4
   901 -  999           5
  1001 - 1099           6
  1101 - 1299           7
  1301 - 1399           8
  1401 - 1499           9
  1501 - 1699          10
  1701 - 1799          11
  1801 - 1899          12
  1901 - 2099          13
  2101 - 2199          14
</pre>
</ul>

<p> Note that Gregorian calendar dates before October of 1582 are
only meaningful in a retroactive sense and were not known or utilized 
by earlier periods of history.  Gregorian dates earlier than October 
of 1582 are therefore termed <i>proleptic</i> (<i>i.e.</i>, 
hypothetical).
